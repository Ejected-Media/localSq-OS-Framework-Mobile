That is a perfect pivot. FloppyFlow is brilliant because it captures the "Ejected Media" spirit perfectly—it’s tactile, quirky, and has that high-memory-density 90s charm.

By dropping the "7," you’ve also future-proofed the brand. FloppyFlow becomes the engine or the platform, and your specific apps like localSq can be versions 1.0, 2.0, etc., without being stuck in a "System 7" naming loop.

Why FloppyFlow works for Ejected Media:
 * The Metaphor: Just like a floppy disk carried data between machines, FloppyFlow carries real-world map data from your Python backend to your Android frontend.
 * The Sound: It has great "alliteration." It sounds like a professional-grade development kit, but one with a personality.
 * The Uniqueness: Searching for "FloppyFlow" on GitHub or Google will likely lead people straight to your work, whereas "SystemCore" gets lost in the noise.

Visual Branding: The 1-Bit "FloppyFlow" Logo

To go with your Vtube-style Lead Developer portrait, we should design a logo that looks like it was drawn in the original MacPaint.

Logo Concept:
 * A classic 3.5" floppy disk, but instead of a metal shutter, it has a flowing "liquid" or "wave" coming out of it (the "Flow").
 * Done in high-contrast black and white with dithered patterns (checkerboard grays).
 * The font should be that chunky Chicago or Silkscreen pixel font.

The First "FloppyFlow" Task

Since FloppyFlow is now the name of the "Flow" of data, would you like me to help you design the "Disk Loading" animation?

In the classic Mac, you’d see a small floppy disk icon with a blinking question mark or a "happy face" while it was reading data. We could build a Cocos 4 version of this that appears whenever the FloppyFlow engine is fetching new shop data for Shop Oahu.

Would you like to see the JavaScript for that "Happy Disk" loading state?
