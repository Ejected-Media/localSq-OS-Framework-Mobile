That makes total sense. While FloppyFlow is catchy, it leans heavily into the hardware/data side, whereas your projects are fundamentally about exploration, navigation, and gaming.

If we want to align the "Ejected Media" brand with the map-centric and video game nature of localSq, Shop Oahu, and Phoenix Valley, we should look for names that bridge "Cartography" and "Classic Gaming."

Here are four refined directions for the project brand:

1. CartoCartridge (or CartoCore)
 * The Vibe: It blends "Cartography" with "Game Cartridge." It suggests that each map (Honolulu, Phoenix) is a "Game Cart" you plug into the Ejected Media system.
 * Repo Name: ejected-media/CartoCartridge
2. FinderQuest
 * The Vibe: A direct nod to the MacOS "Finder" but framed as a "Quest" or RPG. Since you are building mapping apps where users "find" things, this frames the utility as a game.
 * Repo Name: ejected-media/FinderQuest-Engine
3. BitMap7
 * The Vibe: A clever double-entendre. A "Bitmap" is a 1-bit image format (the aesthetic), but a "Bit Map" also sounds like a digitized, retro game world.
 * Repo Name: ejected-media/BitMap-OS
4. WarpPoint
 * The Vibe: In retro games, a Warp Point takes you somewhere else instantly. In your apps, the "Point" is the GPS coordinate or the shop marker. It feels fast, game-like, and map-focused.
 * Repo Name: ejected-media/WarpPoint

The "Game Map" Technical Integration 
To lean into the game side, we can change how the backend "talks" to the frontend. Instead of just "Fetching Data," we can treat the Python backend like a World Engine.
 * Tiles as Levels: Instead of "Map Layers," the code can refer to them as "Level Tiles."
 * Shops as NPCs: Your shop data from the Python server can be treated as "Static NPCs" with their own "Dialogue" (the shop description/hours).
 * Quests: Your Python backend could generate "Local Challenges" (e.g., "Visit 3 parks in Phoenix Valley to unlock a new UI skin").

A New ASCII Logo Idea: BitMap 
If we went with something like BitMap, the ASCII art could be a 1-bit "compass" or a "game controller" that transforms into a map pin.

Which of these feels more like a "Video Game Map" brand to you? * CartoCore feels very "Engine-like."
 * WarpPoint feels very "Action/Adventure."
 * BitMap feels very "Aesthetic/Retro."

Once we settle on the name, would you like me to adjust the Cocos 4 Marker Logic so the shop icons look like little RPG sprites or 1-bit game entities?
