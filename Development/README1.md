___


In November 2025, the Cocos game engine was fully acquired by SUD, a global gamification interactive (GI) platform, for $72 million. This acquisition marks a significant shift in the engine's development and licensing model.

Key Takeaways from the Acquisition:
 * Fully Open-Source Transition: With the acquisition, the upcoming Cocos 4 will move to a "purely open-source" model. This includes making all core engine code and previously unreleased Command Line Interface (CLI) code free and permanently available to the global community.
 * Deep Integration with SUD: The Cocos team and business operations are being integrated into SUD's ecosystem. SUD plans to use Cocos's lightweight technology to power its in-app game distribution and "SUD OpenPaaS" (Platform as a Service) offerings.
 * AI-Driven Development: A new Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called PinK has been announced. It is designed to fully support AI coding and will include native kits for AI agents and various plugin ecosystems (MCPs).
 * Repository Information: The GitHub link you shared (cocos/cocos4) represents the official home for this next-generation engine, which is being positioned as a global, free, and permanent resource for developers.

This move appears to be a strategic response to the evolving game engine market, ensuring that Cocos remains a dominant force in the mobile and "instant play" (web/mini-game) sectors—areas where you have previously expressed interest for projects like localSq and Shop Oahu.
